## Installation

<!-- ```console
pip install harbor-cli
``` -->

The name `harbor-cli` is in the process of being acquired from its current owner on PyPI.

In the meantime, you can install the package from GitHub, preferably with `pipx`:

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
```

Before the name acquisition process is complete, semantic versioning will not be adhered to and breaking changes may be introduced at any point. Once the package is available on PyPI, semantic versioning will be adhered to and breaking changes will only be introduced in major version updates.

## Usage

```
harbor --help
```
